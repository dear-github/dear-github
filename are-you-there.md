Dear GitHub,

Over two weeks ago, we shared [our open letter](README.md) describing how use of GitHub has become more and more problematic for maintainers of large, popular open source projects. This seemed to strike a chord with many in the open source community as we have gathered an additional 1,400 signatures to our original letter.

In that time, our letter was covered by [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/news/2016/01/dear-github-letter), [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/life/16/1/weekly-open-source-news-january-23), [ITPro](http://www.itpro.co.uk/open-source/25887/frustrated-developers-sign-github-protest-letter), [InfoWorld](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3023356/open-source-tools/disgruntled-devs-vent-github-grievances-on-github.html), [ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.com/article/github-developers-express-anger-at-lack-of-support-bug-fix-issues/), [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/19/githubs_become_impenetrable_and_unresponsive_say_devs/), [The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/01/19/frustrated-developers-from-the-webs-biggest-projects-say-github-isnt-listening/#gref), and more.

We also received an unexpected response from [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/01/15/making-gitlab-better-for-large-open-source-projects/), in which they took the time to address each and every bullet point we mentioned.

That's why we were surprised, and somewhat saddened, to not hear from you.

Don't get us wrong, we never expected you to say you would promise to fix these issues. We understand the economics of running businesses, and that every new feature comes with a cost. That's why many of us have a GitHub subscription - because we enjoy using your product and want to help support it.

However, we are very disappointed that you haven't responded at all. In the original letter, we mentioned feeling frustrated because our feature requests to GitHub support went unanswered.
Seeing the attention the letter created, and how it was picked up across the web, we know that you saw and read it. All we were looking for was a response to our concerns, even if the response was, "we're sorry, we aren't able to do that right now."

We are still impassioned GitHub users and care about the product because it's an important part the open source community. As such, we'd like to give you another opportunity to respond to our letter in whatever way you feel is most appropriate.
