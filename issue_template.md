## Please do not submit issues about GitHub here!

Hi there, thanks for wanting to contribute to this repository.
Please note that this repository was created in early 2016 for
the _sole_ purpose of collecting signatures for an open letter
to GitHub regarding a small number of specific issues with their
service.

The signatures were collected, and GitHub replied, as you can see
[below the original letter](https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/blob/master/README.md).
Therefore this repository successfully served its purpose.

### Reporting other issues about GitHub

Unfortunately GitHub do not offer a public issue tracker in which
to report problems / suggestions regarding their service.  Therefore
if you want to do this, the following process is recommended:

1. Check https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues to see if your
   issue has already been reported there.  https://github.com/isaacs/github
   was started in 2013 precisely [to fill the void left by GitHub's
   decision not to provide their own issue tracker](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/6),
   and it's the most popular initiative of its kind, therefore
   it makes sense for the GitHub community to pool efforts there.

2. If your issue has not already been reported there, 
   [file it!](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/new)

3. Finally, copy the same text into [GitHub's official support 
   request form](https://github.com/contact), and also paste
   the URL linking to the issue you filed in step 2, along with
   a reminder to GitHub that it would really help their community
   if they offered a public issue tracker for their service.
   (Presumably the more people that tell them this, the more
   likely they are to heed the advice.)
   
### GitHub Community Forum

To be fair to GitHub, [in November 2017](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-01-connect-with-developers-around-the-world-on-the-github-community-forum/)
they did introduce the [GitHub Community Forum](https://github.community/)
which is arguably a step in the right direction, and you may decide
that you prefer to discuss your topic there rather than following
the recommended procedure above.

However forums are designed for more conversational usage, and are typically
no substitute for the structured approach to issue tracking which is offered
by GitHub's own issue tracker and [many other popular
solutions](https://alternativeto.net/software/redmine/).
